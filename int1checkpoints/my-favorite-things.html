                <p>I play basketball. I believe basketball is a sport of skill and that it takes practice to get better.</p>
                <p>Here are the reasons why:</p>
                <div class="list-center">
                    <ul>
                        <li>It takes a lot of practice to get better at basketball and you can see this from proffessional basketball players and how they practice</li>
                        <li>Basketball takes skill because there are certain techmiques to use to get better </li>
                        <li>Certain shooting forms affect the outcome of your shot</li>
                    </ul>

        <p> I feel that education is a necessasity to have a succesful life. Education leads to better opportunities for better jobs. To do good in school you have to work 
        hard. If you work hard you will get better grades or do good in a sport so that you can
        get into a good college. Also it is also good to do good in a sport and in academic studies to get a scholarship.</p>
