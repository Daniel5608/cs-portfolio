            <h1> How I Made My About Me Page </h1>
            <h2> Navbar </h2>
            <div class="in1">
                <p> The Navbar was there to serve as an easy way to switch from the about me to the "How To" page. I made it by using a list and linked the data inside the list to the 1st and 2nd page 
                so that when you click on whichever one it takes you to the page you want it too, using <strong>&lt;ul&gt;</strong> and I then made it look nice by going to my css file  by taking away the bullet points by 
                using <strong>"list-style:none;"</strong> in my .navbar li class, a border to make it distinct from just text in the background. I then created a more circular border 
                using <strong>"border-radius": 13px; </strong> because that way it looks way more appealing to the user. I also made it so that when you hover over the data in the navbar it changes 
                color to show that you are hovering over it. I did all this with the code to the right.</p> 
                <div class="block1">
                    <div class="top1"><img src="int1checkpoint1/images/Nav1.png" width="600"> </div>
                    <div class="bottom1"><img src="int1checkpoint1/images/Nav2.png" width="600" alt="hello"> </div>
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="in2">
                <h2> Background Color and Border</h2><br>
                <p>For the background color I used an image of lightblue by entering the code of <strong> "background-image: url();" </strong> because it was the exact color I wanted and it would have been hard to get the 
                exact same color on the rgb scale in numbers. Then I wrapped everything inside the box div which is all the text and the images excluding the navbar, and I created a thick border of 15 pixels of solid light-blue. I made the background 
                inside the border white, using  <strong>"background-color: white;"</strong>, because it goes well with the lightblue on the outside of the border. I mostly only used css for these processes.  </p>
                 <div class="block2">
                    <div class="top2"><img src="int1checkpoint1/images/background1.png" width="600"></div>
                    <div class="bottom2"><img src="int1checkpoint1/images/background2.png"></div>      
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class>
                <h2> Image </h2>
                <p> For the images that I inserted into my about me page I used the url and inserted it into my page with the code of <strong>"&lt;img src=&quot;the url of the image&quot; width=&quot;#&quot; height=&quot;#&quot;&gt;" </strong> The positioning 
                and the height and width you just add width and height and put an equal sign after that and add quotes and add values inside the quotes. To finish, like always close the tag. </p>

                    <div class="top3"><img src="int1checkpoint1/images/img1.png" width="700"></div>

            </div>
            <div class="in4">
            <h2> Paragraph tags </h2><br>
            <p> I used paragraph tags after every subtitle or h2 because it is great for organization and you can add classes to the p tags to affect a certain p tag with an attribute. They also automatically skip a line for you, 
            so you don't have to enter a &lt;br&gt; tag. </p>

                <div class="top4"><img src="int1checkpoint1/images/paragraph1.png" width="900"></div>
                <div class="bottom4"></div>      
            </div>
            </div>
            <div class="in5">
                <h2> Header </h2><br>
                <p> I used 3 types of header in my about me page. I used the h1 tag to create the title of the page which read "Who Am I? What have I learned?" to emphasize it is what the whole page is going to be about. The h3 tags I used for subtitles 
                of which I used to tell what I learned and then I used the p-tags to to explain the subtitle. The h3's were also there to show what that paragraph or division would be about. The last header was the h4 I used which was for the title of the 
                are of where I included links for users to learn more about what I had learned. Headers are useful for titles of certain parts of your webpage. They go all the way to h6 for different occurences or parts of the website. </p>
                <div class="block5">
                    <div class="top5"><img src="int1checkpoint1/images/headers1.png" width="600"></div>
                    <div class="bottom5"><img src="int1checkpoint1/images/headers2.png"></div>      
                </div>
            </div>
            <h2> Align: Right, Left, Center and Inline Block</h2>
            <p> I aligned most of my text on the left of side of the div, box, by entering <strong>"text-align:left;"</strong> into the cssand everything other than the title is not in the center. I did this using the code <strong>"text-align:center;"</strong> 
            in the css file. I did not align anything on the right but if you wanted to you would enter <strong>"text-align:right;"</strong>. I added my image at the very top, but at first it was under the text because I had not added "display:in-line block." 
            I later added this and it put the image to the right of the text like it is now. This is because this piece of code tells the webpage to show the two elements on the same line. </p>
            <div class="block6">
                <div class="top6"><img src="int1checkpoint1/images/align1.png"></div>
                <div class="bottom6"><img src="int1checkpoint1/images/Align2.png"></div>      
            </div>
            <h2> Margin and Padding </h2> 
            <p> On my page I used margins to seperate the background of the box and the background of the text and the background of the text inside the box. The margins also display the size of the box and how long, tall, wide, or short it is. To use margins you 
            just enter the code<strong>"margin-left:#px or margin: #%;"</strong> and <strong>"margin-right:#px or margin: #%;"</strong> to control the sides of your box and the percent is the percentage of how much screen it takes up, while pixels stay the same for 
            every screen. The padding, how-ever determines the distance of the text and the contents of the box from the edges of the it. It makes your webpage better-looking, and it looks more proffessional when your contents are not touching the walls of your margins 
            and the border. To use padding you just use <strong>"padding:#px"</strong>. Where the hashtag is is the value which determines the distance between the words and the visible border.</p>

            <h2> Css </h2>
            <div class="colors">
                <p>Css is used to make your website look good and it uses color and it adds interest to your website and it makes it more appealing to the user. You can do lots with css, but it is almost always used for color and more </p>
                <p class="e1" align="left">This is Red!</p>
                <p class="e2" align="center">This is Blue!<p>

            <h2>Lists</h2>
            <div class="in8">
                <p>On my page I used an ordered list in the subsection of lists to show how to use lists and I also used an unordered list when I listed websites to learn more about coding and computer science. I used lists in the part where I talked about how to do lists 
                and how they are useful to show an example of how to use a list and I used an unordered list. An ordered list uses &lt;ol&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;. An unordered list uses &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;. In the section of me listing other sites to learn more I used an unordered 
                list because I used because I was simply listing websites that you could click on to visit. </p>
