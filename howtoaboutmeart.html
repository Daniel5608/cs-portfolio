        <h2> My Function </h2>
        <img src = "int2checkpoint2/images2/function.png">
        <p>In the first requirement I created a image of a spaceship in the very 
        center of the window(keep in mind the entire window <br>is 1000 by 1000) using 
        rectangles with no stroke. I colored and positioned the rectangles accordingly 
        to come together to actually look like a spaceship. After I positioned all the 
        rectangles in the center of the window I created a function by entering my own 
        function into my code. I did this by entering drawSpaceship = function() { before 
        the all the rectangles and }; to end the code. Next I changed all the x and y values 
        for each rectangle to be relative to 500 so each value of x and y would be either 500 
        + a number or 500 - a number. The reason I did is so that later on when I drag the mouse 
        the spaceship follows the mouse exactly. After changing the values of the x and y to 
        become relative to 500, I enter x,y into the parenthesis in the beginning of the function, 
        where I named it, so that it became drawSpaceship = function<strong>(x,y)</strong>. After 
        this you change every 500 in the x and y values to x and y as shown in the image.</p>
        <img src = "int2checkpoint2/images2/mousemovement.png">
        <p>Next you set up the actual spaceship movement by setting it so that your function is drawn 
        where your mouse is; therefore, you enter mouseX and mouseY as the x position and y position 
        for your function(you put the entire code, as shown in the image, in your draw function). </p>
        <img src = "int2checkpoint2/images2/SpaceshipMovement.gif" height = "400" width = "400">
        <p>As you can see all these steps that I took were meant to make the spaceship follow your mouse 
        whenever you move it. This is the function that I chose to include in my project to cause the 
        spaceship to follow the mouse.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>My Interaction and Loop</h2>
        <p>Next I decided I wanted the spaceship to be able to fire red missiles when you click, so I first 
        created a variable called misslesArray. </p>
        <img src = "int2checkpoint2/images2/missilesArrayVariable.png" height="25">
        <p>Next, after the variable misslesArray was created I made a mouseClicked function. Inside it I typed missilesArray.push
        which adds itmes to the end of the array constantly. Inside the array I put a list that consisted of the xPos being mouseX 
        first, then the yPos being mouseY-100 so that the red bullet starts at the top of the spaceship rather in the middle of the spaceship.
        Third in the array I put a move function and inside that, I put this.yPos =- 10 so that whenever I click, the y of the missile moves 
        upwards toward 0 on the y axis. Next in the array as the last item I put a draw function and inside that I entered the actual missile 
        that would be fired from the spaceship and I colored it red. </p>
        <img src = "int2checkpoint2/images2/MisslesFire.png">
        <p>In all the project looked like a spaceship that follows the mouse movement 
        and fires missiles when clicked.</p>
        <img src = "int2checkpoint2/images2/SpaceshipShooting.gif" width="350" height="350">
        <p>However, there still was a problem. The push function keeps drawing more and more missiles, but the missiles are not getting deleted, 
        so this lags the computer. What I did to fix this problem was I created code, with a for loop, that deleted the missiles whenever they 
        moved off the screen. Inside the for loop I created a variable called i and set it to 0. Then as my conditional statement i entered i 
        is less than misslesArray.length. As the last statement of the for loop I entered i++. Inside the for loop I put the move and draw function 
        used in the mouseClicked function and set them dependent on the variable i by entering i into the brackets after missilesArray. Finally, I 
        put an if statement, based on if missilesArray[i].yPos is less than 0, that has missilesArray.splice(i,1). .splice is meant to delete the 
        missiles after they reach the point below 0 on the y-axis. The i and 1 in the parenthesis tells missilesArray how to splice the missile.</p>

        <br>
        <h2>My If Statements </h2>     
        <p>Next I decided to make the spaceship look like it is in actual space with stars. To do this I created exactly 6 variables equal to negative 
        numbers, ordered from least to greatest, that are each larger than the one before it by a similar number. Then I created 18 ellipses inside the 
        draw function, f for the first three y coordinate, c for the next three y coordinates, a for the next, then d, then b, and finally n for the last 
        three coordinates of the y axis for the last three ellipses. The x-axis coordinates are created to be positioned accordingly to look like stars that are spread out, while 
        the height is generally the same for all the ellipses and the width is as well. After the coordinates and ellipses were all written out I added every 
        variable equals the variable plus 20 so the stars are moving down by 20 constantly. Finally, to create a kind of loop, I made 6 if statements in which 
        I entered if any of the variables becomes larger than 1000 then they reset to their original values. So the stars basically move down and after they 
        move off the screen, they go back to their original positions; furthermore, creating a kind of loop. </p>

        <p>Basically the final product ended up looking like this:</p>
